add `AddressDiff`. `LengthedInstruction::len` now return `AddressDiff`. the length of an instruction is the difference between two addresses, not itself an address.

## 0.0.3

`ColorSettings` gets a default impl

## 0.0.2

add `AddressDisplay` to provide a usable interface to display `Address` implementors.

at the same time, remove `Address::stringy()`. it was a very bad interface, and will not be missed.

## 0.0.1
